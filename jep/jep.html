  <h5>A Byte Jam team since November 2020<h5>
  <h4>OUR MISSION</h4>
  <div class ="para">
	<p>Our team, Team Rocket, (named after the first country to go to the moon, not the Pokemon team, common misconception) was founded on the belief Game Show trivia is a true American Tradition. We thought it couldn't possibly get <i>more</i> american, and therein lay the problem that we solve here today. Using the latest technology, namely <strong>C sharp, HTML, and CSS</strong>, we have created a modern marvel. The classic game show that families have known and loved for generations, but using only American themed questions.  Questions that matter to the American people, wholesome questions that strengthen our bond with our nation. <br><br>We thought to ourselves, why ask questions about obscure <i>European</i> history like Mozart, Shakespeare and King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia, when we can ask questions about <b>baseball</b>, <b>state capitals</b>, and <b>our own nation's past leaders</b>? This new game will be more American than apple pie, more American than the <b>TRUE</b> version of football, and more American than good 'ol Uncle Sam. With this new game, we set the standard for patriotism, and we hope that you enjoy sharing it with your friends and family as much as we enjoyed making it. <br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Team Rocket<small>(Trademark pending)</small> </p>
